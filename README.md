# Polstellar

Hi,

Polstellar is a bridge between Polkadot Blockchain &amp; Stellar Blockchain.

We are making a blockchain bridge to integrate 2 of the revolutions of Blockchain Industry, 1) Stellar Blockchain and 2) Polkadot Blockchain.

We are coding a Polkadot Substrate runtime in rust that can understand Stellar Blockchain. It is an open source project and all are invited to contribute.

Thanks!
